    <h3>The Milanesa a la Napolitana is a typical dish of Argentina that has its origin in the influence of Italian immigration.</h3>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>4 milanesa-style cutlets (they may come this way, if not, slice top sirloin lengthwise into slices about 1/3 inch thick)</li>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    <li>1 cup (110g) breadcrumbs</li>
    <li>2 tbsp dried parsley</li>
    <li>salt, to taste</li>
    <li>pepper, to taste</li>
    <li>oil, for frying</li>
    <li>8-10 slices of prosciutto</li>
    <li>1 cup (260g) tomato sauce</li>
    <li>2 cups (225g) mozzarella, sliced</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Beat the cutlets to the desired thickness.</li>
    <li>Whisk the eggs, parsley, salt, and pepper in a large shallow container, pour the breadcrumbs on a large, flat plate.</li>
    <li>First, dip the cutlets into the egg mixture, and then coat them with breadcrumbs.</li>
    <li>Arrange the breaded cutlets on a plate, then place the plate in the refrigerator between several hours to up to overnight.</li>
    <li>Pour a half an inch of oil into the pan, and then heat it over medium-high heat.</li>
